# Curry and Code - personal blog

With thanks to Gatsby and [this repo](https://github.com/thomaswang/gatsby-personal-starter-blog).

To develop:

`npx gatsby develop` spins up:

- http://localhost:8000
- `/blog`
- `/___graphql` for a GraphQL explorer
- `/admin` for the CMS

Currently hosted at https://stately-bunny-7bb6bc.netlify.app/ via Netlify.

### Things to do

- [x] Tidy up README, generic content etc
- [ ] Register domain and plug into Netlify (update URLs in various config files after)
- [ ] First post - Python environments
- [ ] Second post - how this thing works (auth, CI, GraphQL thing)
- [ ] Third post - review of Chaskaa
- [ ] Plan for publicising - probably Reddit + Mastodon/Twitter
- [ ] Basic styling
